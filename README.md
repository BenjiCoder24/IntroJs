## Handout 1: Introduction to JavaScript
### What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language primarily used for creating interactive features on websites. It's an essential part of the web development trio: HTML (structure), CSS (style), and JavaScript (behavior).
Unlike HTML and CSS, which are markup and style sheet languages respectively, JavaScript is a true programming language that enables you to implement complex features on web pages.
JavaScript Capabilities:

+ **Client-Side Operations**: JavaScript runs in the user's web browser and can be used to control webpage behavior, validate forms, create cookies, and more.

+ **Server-Side Development**: With environments like Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for backend development.
#### Why Learn JavaScript?

It's one of the most popular programming languages globally.
Essential for web development and has a wide range of applications, from web apps to game development.

### Handout 2: Basic JavaScript Program
#### Variables in JavaScript:

+ Used to store data values. JavaScript uses let, const, and var for variable declarations.
let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement.
const is used to declare variables whose values cannot be reassigned.
Creating Interactive Web Elements:

+ JavaScript interacts with HTML/CSS to manipulate webpage content.
Example: Drawing a circle that follows the mouse.
canvas element in HTML is used as a drawing surface.
addEventListener listens for mouse movement.
getContext and arc methods of the canvas are used to draw.
Sample Program:

Detailed code explanation that demonstrates creating a canvas and drawing a circle that follows the mouse cursor.
### Handout 3: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
#### What is OOP?

+ A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).
Key Concepts in OOP:

+ Class: Template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
Object: Instance of a class. An object in JavaScript is a standalone entity, with properties and type.
Encapsulation:

+ Encapsulation is the bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data under a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the methods and data.
Handout 4: Refactoring into a Class
From Functions to Classes:

+ Transitioning from a simple function-based approach to a class-based approach. This involves encapsulating functionality within a class.
Creating a Class in JavaScript:

Detailed explanation of the Circle class example, breaking down the constructor and methods like updateMousePosition and draw.
Advantages of Using Classes:

**Organizes code**: easier to read, maintain, and debug.
Reusability: once a class is written, it can be used to create numerous objects.
Conclusion and Further Resources
Recap and Encouragement:

JavaScript is a versatile language with wide-ranging applications.
Encourage students to experiment with code and build their own small projects.
Resources for Further Learning:

**MDN Web Docs**: Comprehensive resource for learning JavaScript.
Online Tutorials and Courses: Websites like Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, and others offer interactive JavaScript courses.
JavaScript Frameworks: As students advance, they can explore frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js for more complex applications.Introduction to Java Script
